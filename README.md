# ColorPong
This is ColorPong! A simple, basic game of pong created with vanilla JavaScript and CSS! Are you good enough to beat the computer? Probably not, but give it a try at https://www.pong.aaronnn.com !
# Inspiration
The creation of this game was inspired by Lex Fridman's Introduction to Machine Learning (MIT Sloan) video. It can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3MuSOl1Rog&ab_channel=LexFridman. He uses pong as a basis of introducing the core concepts of neural networks and pattern recognition to dive deeper into Machine Learning. Although this project is not as sophisticated as the one he displays in this class, this was still an interesting project to explore nonetheless.
# NOTE
This game gets harder as you go on, a responsive mouse/trackpad will be ideal!
